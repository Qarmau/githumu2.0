i want you to create two extra buttons(upload past paper, upload revision material), next to create holiday assignment button on the holiday_assignments.html.
IT SHOULD LEAD TO THE 2 RESPECTIVE PAGES WHERE USERS UPLOAD THE FILES.this ones created should be connected to the models PastPaper and RevisionMaterial.

the forms created should be consistent with the models.

only logged in user can do this.

style the two pages created to be consistent with the holiday_assignments.html
